Think about how difficult it has been to get the correct data out of receipts

Noticed that it is pretty good at getting the prices

We know that the total will always be the largest value listed on the receipt

Just need to get all the lines with prices, and choose the greatest prices as the total, then we can put more focus into getting individual items
